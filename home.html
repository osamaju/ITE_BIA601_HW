        <h1>Assembly Line Scheduling Problem</h1>
        <p>
            The Assembly Line Scheduling Problem is a classic optimization challenge in manufacturing, where the goal is
            to determine the most efficient path for assembling a product across parallel production lines to minimize
            total production time. This problem is efficiently solved using <strong>Dynamic Programming (DP)</strong>,
            which breaks the problem into smaller subproblems and solves each independently. Temporary solutions are
            stored in a table to avoid redundant calculations, making the solution fast and effective even as the number
            of stations increases.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How Does It Work?</strong><br>
            1. Calculate the time to reach each station on both lines.<br>
            2. Determine the optimal path based on the minimum total time.<br>
            3. The final result is the optimal total assembly time.
